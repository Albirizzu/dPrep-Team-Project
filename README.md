# Being a super-host: worth the effort?

__Research Question__
Is there a difference in pricing between super hosts and non-super hosts in Venice?

## Motivation
The purpose of this research is to figure out if there is a difference in pricing between hosts and super-hosts in Venice. Is choosing a Superhost over a host really worth the cost? And is there such a big difference between the two types of hosts?

First of all, we need to explain what "Superhosts" are, that is: they are experienced hosts who provide a shining example for other hosts, and extraordinary experiences for their guests. Airbnb checks Superhostsâ€™ activity four times a year, to ensure that the program highlights the people who are most dedicated to providing outstanding hospitality.

Why do we choose Venice? Venice is one of the three most visited cities in Italy with 12.948.519 of tourists in 2019 (ISTAT website - National Institute of Statistics, Nov, 2020) and with 7947 accommodations on Airbnb (Inside Airbnb, Aug 6, 2021). 

Price is one of the main factors guests consider when choosing where to stay. The price difference and competitiveness in the market many times leads hosts to change their pricing strategy. Usually Superhosts have more visibility and earning potential, but does this mean a higher price than a host? In this research, we will investigate the correlation between pricing and type of host and as it may change the hosts' strategies.

Our results will help Airbnb hosts and Superhosts get more information on pricing strategy and adjust it based on the type of hosts they are and the experiences they offer.

## Data
The team project draws on datasets from [Inside Airbnb](http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data.html) which is an independent open-source data tool developed by community activist Murray Cox who aims to shed light on how [Airbnb](http://airbnb.com) is being used and affecting neighborhoods in large cities. The tool provides a visual overview of the amount, availability, and spread of rooms across a city, as well as an approximation of the number of bookings and occupancy rate.
