# dPrep-Team-Project
Change repository name to something related to research question

## Motivation
__Research question__
Motivation: Write as though if you work for Airbnb

## Data
The team project draws on datasets from Inside Airbnb which is an independent open-source data tool developed by community activist Murray Cox who aims to shed light on how Airbnb is being used and affecting neighborhoods in large cities. The tool provides a visual overview of the amount, availability, and spread of rooms across a city, as well as an approximation of the number of bookings and occupancy rate.
